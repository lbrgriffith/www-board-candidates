I am a seasoned cybersecurity expert with over 18 years of experience in security engineering, compliance, and DevSecOps. Since becoming an OWASP member in 2022, I have dedicated myself to helping organizations achieve and maintain robust security by implementing OWASP Top 10 and ASVS, ensuring robust protection of their digital assets against evolving cyber threats. My career is marked by a steadfast commitment to safeguarding digital systems across high-profile and demanding sectors, positioning me as a trusted authority in the field. I hold several prestigious certifications, including Information Systems Professional of Canada (ISP), IT Certified Professional (ITCP), and Chartered IT Professional (CITP), and I am an Associate Member of the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants. This multidisciplinary expertise allows me to seamlessly integrate advanced security technologies with established protocols, designing adaptable and reliable security frameworks tailored to diverse industry needs.

In addition to my technical prowess, I actively contribute to influential organizations that shape the future of digital governance and security. I have served as an External Expert in Cybersecurity and Cryptography for the EU COST Office since 2013 and am an active member of the Digital Trust and Identity and Biometrics Working Groups at the Digital Governance Standards Institute of Canada. My involvement with the Cloud Security Allianceâ€™s Serverless Working Group and as a Founding Member of the Cloud Credential Council further underscores my leadership in advancing cybersecurity practices. My roles on the Member Vendor Advisory Council of CompTIA, the Board of Directors of Disability Support International, and Warrior Films demonstrate my commitment to leveraging technology for broader societal impact. As a candidate for the OWASP Board of Directors, I am eager to leverage my extensive experience and strategic vision to drive initiatives that enhance security practices, promote compliance, and protect digital ecosystems worldwide.

### Questions

### What unique strategic goal do you intend to bring on board, if you are elected? ###
If elected, my unique strategic goal is to establish an OWASP Innovation Lab that spearheads the development of cutting-edge security solutions for emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing. This lab will foster collaborative research and create advanced tools to address the unique vulnerabilities these technologies present. Additionally, I aim to enhance the security of critical infrastructure sectors like healthcare, finance, and energy by developing specialized guidelines and resources tailored to their specific needs. By integrating these initiatives, we will not only drive innovation within the OWASP community but also ensure that essential systems are robustly protected in an increasingly complex and technologically advanced landscape.

### What is your vision for OWASP over the next three to five years? ###
Over the next three to five years, I envision OWASP becoming the go-to resource for not just web application security but all facets of software security. I see us expanding our projects and tools to cover areas like cloud security, Quantum Computing Security, Blockchain and AI. My vision includes a more interconnected community where knowledge sharing is seamless, and our resources are accessible to everyone, everywhere.

### What contributions have you personally made to OWASP or other open source projects? ###
I have been passionately immersed in the cybersecurity community, driving impactful advancements through my contributions to numerous open-source security projects and cutting-edge research initiatives. My dedication to combating cyber threats is demonstrated by my work in reverse-engineering 20 ransomware strains, including notorious ones like Conti and LockerGoga, which has provided invaluable insights for organizations to defend against these malicious attacks. 

I have also meticulously reverse engineered 15 cryptominers involved in cryptojacking operations, aiding in the development of robust strategies to detect and neutralize these covert threats. My commitment to enhancing security extends to responsibly reporting vulnerabilities to industry giants such as Microsoft, LinkedIn, and Facebook, directly strengthening their security infrastructures. As a dedicated Hacker Member of Hack The Box, I continuously hone my skills through challenging exercises and contribute to a vibrant community focused on advancing cybersecurity knowledge. 

Furthermore, my 17 published research papers have been instrumental in guiding researchers and developers, particularly in creating effective contact tracing applications during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through these diverse and meaningful contributions, I have not only propelled the field of cybersecurity forward but also exemplified a steadfast commitment to collaboration, innovation, and the protection of our digital environments.

### What strategies would you implement to increase community engagement and participation in OWASP? ###
To boost community engagement, I would focus on enhancing our mentorship programs to pair seasoned professionals with newcomers. I'd also advocate for more virtual events and webinars to make participation easier regardless of geographical location. Additionally, I plan to collaborate with educational institutions to introduce OWASP resources into curricula, fostering early interest and involvement.

### What will be your efforts to ensure OWASP continues to be a centerpiece in software security? ###
I will prioritize keeping our projects and tools at the cutting edge of technology by supporting continuous innovation and encouraging contributions that address emerging threats. By fostering partnerships with industry leaders and academic institutions, we'll ensure that OWASP remains a trusted and authoritative voice in software security.

### What should OWASP stop doing and why? ###
OWASP should consider consolidating projects that have overlapping goals or that are no longer actively maintained. Spreading our resources too thin can hinder the effectiveness of our key initiatives. By focusing on high-impact projects and streamlining our efforts, we can provide greater value to the community and maintain the quality and relevance of our offerings.
